## Hi there

I'm **Low** Chin Chau and Zipify Pte Ltd is my technology consulting company for helping businesses deliver services online.
My special interests are in delivering business services through online and mobile devices, and in ensuring that the systems implemented are secured, reliable, cost-effective, and able to grow with the business.

I am an experienced software development practitioner and senior project manager.
I have held senior technical and general management positions in the public service, research institutes and private companies, and was a co-founder of Integro Technologies, a banking software provider where I served as President and CTO.
Most recently, I was the CTO of Ufinity Pte Ltd, where I set up systems and software development teams, processes,
infrastructure and tools, implemented agile development practices, and outsourcing structures and processes.

To contribute back to the community, I chair the ITSC Data-as-a-Service Working Group, and serve on committees such as the SCS SME Liaison Committee, the SITF Productivity and Productisation Programme Office, and the ITSC CodeXtreme competition organising committee.
